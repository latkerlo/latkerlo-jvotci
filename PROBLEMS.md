# oh no

(all of these are also in "Issues"land)

## 3. misidentifying slinku'i

In `Fr`, Rust thinks `u'ykerlo` is a slinku'i. It isn't because putting `pa` in front of it would be `pa.u'ykerlo`.

## 4. not identifying tosmabru before `y'`

Rust decomposes `lavlevlivy'ismu` into `lav-lev-liv-y'-ismu` rather than `la vle-vliv-y'-ismu`.

`lavlevy'ismu` works correctly everywhere (i.e. `la vlevy'ismu`).

## 5. I don't know what to call this one

Rust can decompose `ke'ery'u` in `r` (except `Fr`) and `ke'erytce` in non-`F`. ???
